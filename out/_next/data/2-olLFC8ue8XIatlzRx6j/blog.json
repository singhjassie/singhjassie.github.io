This is part of our commitment to provide the latest version of every most important software while choosing a stable LTS release model.\n\nTo make sure to have all the latest packages installed from our backports channel, use the following commands:\n\n* `sudo apt update`\n* `sudo apt full-upgrade -t parrot-backports`\n\n## System updates\n\nThe system has received important updates to some opf its key packages, like parrot-menu, which now provides additional launchers to our newly imported tools; or parrot-core, which now provides a new firefox profile with improved security hardening, plus some minor bugfixes to our zshrc configuration.\n\n## Firefox profile overhault\n\nAs mentioned earlier, our Firefox profile has received a major update that significantly improves the overall privacy and security.\n\nOur bookmarks collection has been revamped, and now includes new resources, including OSINT services, new learning sources and other useful resources for hackers, developers, students and security researchers.\n\nWe have also boosted our effort to avoid Mozilla telemetry and bring DuckDuckGo back as the default search engine, while we are exploring other alternatives for the future.\n\n## Tools updates\n\nMost of our tools have received major version updates, especially our reverse engineering tools, like rizin and rizin-cutter.\n\nImportant updates involved metasploit, exploitdb and other popular tools as well.\n\n\n## New AnonSurf 4.0\n\nThe new AnonSurf 4 represents a major upgrade for our popular anonymity tool.\n\nAnonsurf is our in-house anonymity solution that routes all the system traffic through TOR automatically without having to set up proxy settings for each individua program, and preventing traffic leaking in most cases.\n\nThe new version provides significant fixes and reliability updates, fully supports debian systems without the old resolvconf setup, has a new user interface with improved system tray icon and settings dialog window, and offers a better overall user experience.\n\n\n## Parrot IoT improvements\n\nOur IoT version now implements significant performance improvements for the various Raspberry Pi boards, and finally includes Wi-Fi support for the Raspberry Pi 400 board.\n\nThe Parrot IoT offering has also been expanded, and it now offers Home and Security editions as well, with a full MATE desktop environment exactly like the desktop counterpart.\n\n\n## Architect Edition improvements\n\nOur popular Architect Edition now implements some minor bugfixes and is more reliable than ever.\n\nThe Architect Edition is a special edition of Parrot that enables the user to install a barebone Parrot Core system, and then offers a selection of additional modules to further customize the system.\n\nYou can use Parrot Architect to install other desktop environments like KDE, GNOME or XFCE, or to install a specific selection of tools.\n\n## New infrastructure powered by Parrot and Kubernetes\n\nThe Architect Edition is also used internally by the Parrot Engineering Team to install Parrot Server Edition on all the servers that power our infrastructure, which is officially 100% powered by Parrot and Kubernetes.\n\nThis is a major change in the way we handle our infrastructure, which enables us to implement better autoscaling, easier management, smaller attack surface and an overall better network, with the improved scalability and security we were looking for.","slug":"2022-09-24-parrot-5.1-release-notes"},{"date":"Jul 8, 2022","title":"A hidden gem from a technical POV","author":"Dm Knght","image":"/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/a_hidden_gem.png","description":"An overview of our updater","content":"\r\n## How do you check for an update?\r\n\r\nThe answer is straightforward `sudo apt update`. It’s the default used in the Debian documentation (technically apt is different from apt-get and aptitude but the method is similar):\r\n\r\n[https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/uptodate.en.html](https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/debian-faq/uptodate.en.html)\r\n\r\n## So, how does it work ?\r\nThe user must open a terminal, type \"sudo apt update\", press enter,  enter the user password then press enter again.\r\nIn the previous versions of Parrot, we had an “update reminder” that launches `sudo apt update` from the menu, so the user just needed to click and type the password.\r\n\r\n![1](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/1.png)\r\n\r\nWe are going to the point where “apt update” runs:\r\n\r\n1. The tool parses the repository addresses from “source lists” (we’ll go into more depth later)\r\n2. “apt” connects to the repository and downloads index files (screenshot below)\r\n\r\n![2](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/2.png)\r\n\r\nThe downloaded data from the central repository is quite large (18.9 MB). For Debian, it should be more than 12MB. If you have a low-speed internet connection or limited bandwidth, this is not a nice thing.\r\n\r\nIt can also add repositories for other architectures (i386 for example), which cause more files to be downloaded, even going so far as to download over 30 MB. The more repositories you have, and the more architecture you have, the more data you have to spend. 30 MB is not very nice, huh?\r\n\r\nLuckily, if you downloaded the latest index files, you don’t have to download them again.\r\n\r\n![3](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/3.png)\r\n\r\nSo why and how? (We’ll into this later. For now, I would like to point out some problems :)\r\n\r\n1. The downloaded data is too big if you just want to know about available updates\r\n2. It’s slow (well, not really, but can we make it faster?)\r\n3. sudo password everytime. Can we just check for updates without it but at the same time not compromise security policies?\r\n\r\n## APT and repository address behind the scene\r\n\r\n[https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format#Overview](https://wiki.debian.org/DebianRepository/Format#Overview)\r\n\r\n![4](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/4.png)\r\n\r\nFrom reading the documentation and screenshot above, it’s a little hard to understand. So let’s try with Parrot’s repository.\r\n\r\n![5](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/5.png)\r\n\r\nLet’s try with URL, I’m using [https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot](https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot)\r\n\r\n![6](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/6.png)\r\n\r\nWhere is the value “parrot” as “distribution”? Isn’t it a URL mapping? Well… yes, it’s in dist.\r\n![7](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/7.png)\r\n\r\nNow you can see “parrot”. But hold on, let me show you the “pool” first:\r\n\r\nWhat’s in “pool”? Only branches. What does it contain? It has everything about a package:\r\ncompiled deb files, source code, etc.\r\n\r\n![8](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/8.png)\r\n\r\n![9](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/9.png)\r\n\r\nLooks like “pool” is the most important thing on the repository. But why is there a “dists”?\r\n\r\nInside “dist” of distribution “parrot” (we’d like to call it a branch instead of distribution), there are component folders and 3 files:\r\n\r\n1. InRelease\r\n2. Release\r\n3. Release.gpg, which should be the GPG key\r\n\r\n![10](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/10.png)\r\n\r\nLet's see what it contains. First with *Release*:\r\n\r\n![11](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/11.png)\r\n\r\nAnd then *InRelease*:\r\n\r\n![12](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/12.png)\r\n\r\nThese 2 files look similar. The difference is as follows. *InRelease* also contains a GPG key-value, whereas *Release* has only regular metadata. So why do we have to read all of this? Either Release or InRelease has section Date.\r\n\r\n![13](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/13.png)\r\n\r\nBy assuming all files are generated every time the repository has a new update, we can use it to do checks for update.\r\n\r\nLet’s check the components in \"dists\". We have architectures, and in each architecture directory, we have files that look like this:\r\n\r\n![14](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/14.png)\r\n\r\nThe file Release doesn’t have much info.\r\n\r\n![15](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/15.png)\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Packages contain everything about packages. It’s like you are using `apt show`:\r\n\r\n![16](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/16.png)\r\n\r\nWhat are these used for?\r\n\r\n1. Folder pool contains packages (compiled .deb, source code, debianize, etc).\r\n2. Folder \"dists\" contains metadata of packages.\r\n3. Release and InRelease contains core information: release date, architecture, etc. and a checksum of all Package files.\r\n4. All Package files in components contain information of packages: name,version, depends, etc. Basically it’s a database of `apt show`.\r\n\r\nWe need a method to use either Release or InRelease, which costs only 14KB to check for a new update.\r\n\r\n## A hidden apt spot in your system and the way to use it\r\n\r\nNow we know Packages files are basically a “database” of apt. So where is it in the system?\r\n\r\nIt’s at `/var/lib/apt/lists/`.\r\n\r\n![17](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/17.png)\r\n\r\nAgain, we have to reuse the source list:\r\n\r\n![18](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/18.png)\r\n\r\nFile names in this directory are like this (notice that <address> is converted to <domain>_<path>)<address>_<dists>_<distribution>_\r\nIn the screenshot, we can see many things:\r\n\r\n- InRelease: The metadata file.\r\n- The _Packages, which is the actual database, contains components in the name. By the keyword binary, we can assume it’s about compiled packages (.deb file), and we have source for “apt source” which should have a different name.\r\n- Each repository and each branch has a different InRelease file.\r\n\r\nNow we can fully understand the workflow of `sudo apt update`.\r\n\r\n1. Read the source list, parse addresses.\r\n2. Convert address to actual repository address, download InRelease (which contains a GPG key), and then all Packages files (which are much larger than only InRelease).\r\n3. Convert the actual URL to file name, save in `/var/lib/apt/lists/`.\r\n4. DO NOT download everything if the local file is the latest. I haven’t checked the source code of apt, but I assume it’s sort of checking “Date” in the InRelease file. Well, it’s easy and simple to understand.\r\n\r\nSo we are having everything we need. So, the scope of the update-reminder is:\r\n\r\n1. Only check if a new update is available. We do not compare packages to know what can be upgraded, what will be removed, etc…\r\n2. Save A LOT of network data (about 14KB for a branch/distribution, seriously?).\r\n3. Save A LOT of time by very small data to download (About 70 KB).\r\n4. In the update-reminder, I do parse the section Date and compare date, which should make the code do less comparison.\r\n\r\n![19](/assets/blog/a_hidden_gem/19.png)\r\n","slug":"2022-04-07-a-hidden-gem-from-a-technical-POV"},{"date":"Mar 24, 2022","title":"Parrot 5.0 Press Release","author":"palinuro","image":"/assets/blog/5.0/parrot-5.png","description":"We are proud to announce the release of Parrot OS 5.0.","content":"\nWe are proud to announce the release of Parrot OS 5.0.\nThis new version represents a huge milestone for the project, and introduces several changes and new products to meet the always changing needs of cyber security specialists.\n\n# What’s New with Parrot 5.0\n\nParrot’s main focus on the latest release was on making the system extremely stable and flexible.\nThe system now follows a Long Term Support release model, but provides the latest version of all its tools via extensive backporting, and is never out of date.\nParrot 5.0 was designed with cloud and customizability in mind, and provides several container options to leverage powerful orchestration tools during complex pentest scenarios.\nThe Parrot offering has been simplified, and a new architect edition has been introduced to allow maximum customizability of the system.\n\n\n## Parrot Versions\n\nParrot 5.0 keeps the former Home and Security editions, and introduces a new special HTB edition inspired by the popular PwnBox by HackTheBox.\nThe KDE and XFCE alternatives are no longer available, and are replaced by the Architect edition, which supports also x86 32bit and ARMv8 64bit.\nA first experimental Raspberry pi edition is released, and will be followed by further enhancements and more boards support during the year.\nFurther options are available for containers, chroots and embedded environments.\n\n\n\n### Parrot Home Edition\n\nParrot Home Edition is a general purpose operating system with the typical Parrot look and feel. It is designed for **developers and everyday users** with an emphasis on privacy and software development. Parrot Tools can be manually installed to assemble a custom and lightweight pentesting environment.\n\nParrot 5.0 enhances the pre-installed development tools, making it the perfect system for software developers and students. Vscodium, the open source binary release of the popular VSCode advanced editor, is shipped by default along with all the compilers and interpreters to work with **gcc, go, java, nodejs or python**, with several other options available through the official software repository.\n\n\n### Parrot Security Edition\n\nParrot Security Edition is a special purpose operating system designed for **Penetration Test and Red Team operations**. It contains a full arsenal of ready to use pentest tools.\n\nParrot 5.0 ships with the latest version of the best selection of security tools, while others are available through the official software repository.\nMany new tools were included since the last release, following our attempt to **fill the gap between emerging technologies and the tools to test their security.**\n\n\n### Parrot Architect, IoT and Cloud\n\nOne of the main goals of Parrot 5.0 is to make the Parrot system available on as many platforms as possible. **ARM support is finally back**, and the new LTS release model makes parrot the perfect framework to build advanced security products on top of.\n\nParrot 5.0 offers **4 IoT tarballs**, each for every architecture supported by parrot (amd64, i386, arm64 and armhf). They can be used to build new products, like **WSL and WSL2** containers, **Android** chroot containers, or using the system with popular cloud providers.\n\nThe **Architect Edition** is a minimal iso file of Parrot that provides the installer only. It is available for x86 and arm, and can be used to customize the system installation, like picking a different desktop environment, doing a minimal installation or installing a custom set of tools at install time. It needs an internet connection or a local mirror to install a full desktop system, but it is capable of doing a core installation of the system completely offline.\nIt can be used to install **Parrot on a server**, to configure a custom set of packages or to install the system on a **Mac M1 ARM computer** inside a native virtual machine without intel translation, which boosts the VM performance significantly.\n\nIn addition to this, **Parrot for Docker** enables users to take advantage of the Parrot tools on top of other operating systems or in cloud environments. The Docker offering is especially useful when integrating security checks in a CI pipeline, or when running pentest operations with the help of advanced cloud tools like kubernetes. An emerging trend is also to use these Docker containers to **use the Parrot tools on top of other operating systems**, like Ubuntu, Arch, Fedora or Mac OS, without the performance disadvantage of a full virtual machine.\n\nAlso, in cooperation with **Hack The Box**, Parrot created **PwnBox** a way to use Parrot OS directly in your browser while studying or playing on the Hack The Box platform. And with Parrot 5.0, a custom edition of Parrot with the PwnBox look and feel is available for download too.\n\n\n\n\n\n## Features\n\n### LTS and Backports\n\nParrot 5.0 introduces a new **Long Term Support** release model. All the packages composing the core system are now tracking the latest **Debian Stable** instead of Debian Testing, and will guarantee no significant changes for at least 2 years. This approach makes Parrot more reliable, and system updates will no longer break the system as it happens with other Rolling Release systems.\n\n**Our approach to the LTS release model differs from the one adopted by Debian**. We recognize that no major feature updates and feature deprecations should occur during the lifecycle of the system, but there are some programs that don't follow our same release cycle: many programs, especially desktop ones, don't have a release every 2 years, like Debian does, and when new versions are out, older ones are deprecated and left with no support and security updates. Other times a new software gets a major release just after a new Debian version, and users are forced to stay on the previous version for the next 2 years.\nFor this reason we have decided to **maintain a special backport channel** where not only the debian backports are replicated, but where we work to expand the offering of backported software as much as possible. Users using Parrot will have immediate access to the latest version of most of the programs they use daily. Along with that, users will be able to choose whether to install the backported version or stay with the older and more stable one.\nThe team has also decided to **keep a Rolling Release model for all the security tools**, which will continue to receive rolling updates as soon as they are out.\n\nLast, but not least, the new LTS approach brings **extremely fast security updates**. This makes Parrot 5.0 and future versions, the perfect system for critical environments, like servers, where security is important.\n\n### Linux 5.16 and enhanced hardware support\n\nParrot 5.0 features the latest Linux 5.16 kernel version, which offers the best performance and hardware compatibility.\nIn addition to that, it also offers an extensive collection of pre-installed drivers to make the system compatible with most of the hardware, including most of the wifi dongles, making Parrot the most hardware friendly GNU/Linux distro available.\n\n## Tools\n\nWe have added a plethora of new tools to reveal the full potential of our users and guarantee an immersive experience. \n\nYou can find them below: \n\n**Pocsuite3**\n\npocsuite3 is an open-source remote vulnerability testing and proof-of-concept development framework developed by the Knownsec 404 Team. It comes with a powerful proof-of-concept engine, many nice features for the ultimate penetration testers and security researchers.\n\n**Ivy-optiv**\n\nIvy is a payload creation framework for the execution of arbitrary VBA (macro) source code in memory. Ivy’s loader does this by abusing programmatical access in the VBA object environment to load, decrypt, and execute shellcode. \nJwtxploiter \nA tool to test security of JSON Web Tokens. Jwtxploiter gives the ability to test a JWT against all known CVEs.\n\n**Python3-pcodedmp**\n\nPcodedmp is a very powerful VBA P-Code disassembler that can be used to inspect and work with VBA documents.\n\n**Mimipenguin**\n\nMimipenguin is a free and open source, simple yet powerful Shell/Python script used to dump the login credentials (usernames and passwords) from the current desktop user.\n\n**Ffuf**\n\nffuf is a fest web fuzzer written in Go that allows typical directory discovery, virtual host discovery (without DNS records) and GET and POST parameter fuzzing.\n\n**Oletools**\n\noletools is a package of python tools to analyze Microsoft OLE2 files (also called Structured Storage, Compound File Binary Format or Compound Document File Format), such as Microsoft Office documents or Outlook messages, mainly for malware analysis, forensics and debugging. It is based on the olefile parser.\n\n**findmyhash 2.0**\n\nfindmyhash.py tries to crack different types of hashes using free online services.\n\n**Dirsearch**\n\nAn advanced command-line tool designed to brute force directories and files in webservers, AKA web path scanner.\n\n**Pyinstxtractor**\n\nPyInstaller Extractor is a Python script to extract the contents of a PyInstaller generated Windows executable file. The contents of the pyz file (usually pyc files) present inside the executable are also extracted.\n\n\nand several new tools are available in our repository ready to be explored.\n\n\n\n# Where to get it\n\nYou can download Parrot OS from our [official download page](https://www.parrotsec.org/download), and we invite you to never trust third party and unofficial sources, as they may be counterfeit and pre-packed with malware.\n\nWe also provide official torrent files that can bypass most of the firewalls by leveraging https trackers and using the parrot mirrors as webseeds.\n\n# How to upgrade from a previous version\n\n**We strongly recommend to download the latest version and perform a fresh install**. It makes the system cleaner and more reliable.\n\nThe system is capable of updating every single program provided by the Parrot repository, but the desktop configuration stored in the user home folder can't be altered by system updates (and for a good reason), hence updating the system would not update the latest user settings.\n\n**You can still perform a full system upgrade** from 4.11 to 5.x by running the following command\n```\nsudo parrot-upgrade\n```\nThen reboot the system and perform the upgrade again once over.\n\nthe first upgrade will prepare the system and install the new repositories, and the second upgrade would perform the complete version jump, with the only exception of the user configs stored in the home folder.\n\n\n","slug":"2022-03-24-parrot-5.0-press-release"},{"date":"Mar 28, 2021","title":"Parrot 4.11 Release Notes","author":"palinuro","image":"/assets/blog/4.11/parrot-4.11.jpg","description":"Parrot 4.11 is now available for download, read the release notes","content":"\nWe are proud to announce the release of Parrot OS 4.11.\nThis new version includes many important updates to make the distribution more reliable and more secure.\n\n# Where to get it\n\nYou can download Parrot OS from our [official download page](https://parrotsec.org/download), and we invite you to never trust third party and unofficial sources.\n\nWe also provide official torrent files in case direct downloads don't work for you.\n\n# How to upgrade from a previous version\n\nParrot OS is a rolling release distribution, and updates flow in the repo as soon as they prove to be stable and reliable.\n\nVersion numbers (like 4.10 or 4.11) are just tags that we assign to the current state of the project every time we think there are enough updates accumulated in the repo to justify a refresh of the ISO files. In fact every Parrot version represents exactly a refresh of our ISO files to collect all the updates together into something ready to install and properly tested.\n\nYou can upgrade an existing system via APT using one of the following commands:\n\n`sudo parrot-upgrade`\n\nor\n\n`sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade`\n\nbut we recommend to do a backup and re-install the latest version to have a cleaner and more reliable user experience, especially if you come from a very old version of parrot that were not updated for a long while.e\n\n# What's new\n\n## Debian freezing and LTS plans\n\nDebian is in “feature freeze” state to prepare for the new stable release.\nParrot 4.11 will benefit from this, and all the updates from now on will be subject to more tests.\n\nWe will catch the opportunity of a new Debian release to convert the current branch into a Long Term Support branch with fewer updates for a very reliable user experience.\nThe Long Term Support conversion plan will also re-introduce ARM support and init freedom.\n\nWe are evaluating the idea of continuing to provide a Rolling Release branch along side the LTS one.\n\n## Important updates\n\nLinux 5.10 is the default kernel of this new Parrot version, with better hardware support for very recent hardware.\nWe plan to release Linux 5.11 as soon as possible as a later update.\n\nWe have finally purged many old, broken and unmaintained tools, and revisited many of the existing ones. Our tool metapackages were revisited as well to reflect this little revolution.\nParrot 4.11 provides cleaner metapackages, updated tools and a more consistent repository.\n\nPrevious Parrot versions used to have un-needed services shut down by default, but such services happened to re-enable randomly after system updates. We have enforced some systemd rules to prevent this happening.\n\nCertain tools used for Linux local privilege escalation represented a security hazard for parrot, so we have disabled and unarmed them (i.e. xspy is no longer an executable file in /usr/bin).\n\n\n## Alternate Editions\n\nKde Plasma now works again as expected, and it was updated to provide a better look and feel.\n\nXFCE has been updated with several improvements and fixes.\n\n## Noticeable updates for pentesters\n\nMetasploit framework was updated to 6.0.36, and we keep updating it weekly.\n\nBettercap has finally been updated to 2.29, and 2.30 is coming very soon.\n\nPompem was patched from Parrot team to properly handle down services and use the new wpvulndb server.\n\nRoutersploit was updated to make it work with python 3.9.\n\nXspy was patched to not be executable on host system.\n\nFish and Zsh support is now available in our skel, including the latest zsh-autocomplete version.\n\n\nWe can't report all the updates done to our tools here. If you are interested in a particular package, please read its specific changelog in /usr/share/doc/packagename to know more.\n\n\n## Noticeable updates for developers\n\nVSCodium, the open-source binary distribution of VSCode with telemetry removed at source level, is still our default development tool, and it was updated to its latest version (1.54).

In fact every Parrot version represents exactly a refresh of our ISO files to collect all the accumulated pieces together into something tested and reliable.\n\nYou can upgrade an existing system via APT using one of the following commands:\n\n`sudo parrot-upgrade`\n\nor\n\n`sudo apt update && sudo apt full-upgrade`\n\n# What's new\n\n## AnonSurf 3.0\n\nAnonSurf 3.0 is ready, and it ha many important features.\n\n![](../..//assets/blog/4.10/anonsurf-3.0.jpg)\n\nIt is now subdivided into 3 modules: GUI, Daemon and Utilities.\n\nThe GUI is written in [NIM](https://nim-lang.org), a blazing fast programming language very easy to write and read that compiles in native C code.\nIt uses [Gintro GTK](https://nest.parrotsec.org/packages/debian/gintro) for the interface and it has several features to let the user control the anonsurf behavior.\n\nYou can start, stop and reload anonsurf, you can easily configure anonsurf to automatically start at boot, and it is easy to monitor the status of tor and see the traffic, the logs and some usage statistics thanks to its integration with [NYX](https://nyx.torproject.org/).\n\n![](../..//assets/blog/4.10/anonsurf-screenshot.jpg)\n\nThe new AnonSurf Daemon takes care of shutting down the service automatically at shutdown in case the user powered off the computer with anonsurf enabled, which was a known cause of later connectivity issues in previous versions, and of corurse allows the user to tell the init system to automatically start anonsurf at boot for those who need it.\n\nAnonsurf also ships with some utilities, like a CLI interface: the old famous anonsurf command, which is now an interface for the daemon instead of a standalone tool.\n\nWe also delivered (and updated) dnstool, a software to easily control the behavior of DNS resolution across the system, that allows the user to choose between static and dynamic configurations and to use the servers provided by dhcp, the servers of choice of the user or the servers of the [OpenNIC project](https://www.opennic.org).\n\nAnonSurf is overall more reliable and more stable, and it is an important step forward for the whole project since we deeply believe in privacy and the role it covers in the fight for freedom.\n\n## Linux 5.7\n\nParrot OS now comes with Linux 5.7.\n\n![](../..//assets/blog/4.10/linux-5.7.jpg)\n\nFew important changes of this new kernel version:\n\n* Improved scheduler.\n* new ExFAT filesystem module.\n* Spli Lock detection.\n* userfaultfd() write protection support.\n* A BPF-based Linux Security Module called bpf-lsm.\n* Allow clone3() to spawn processes into cgroups.\n* Improved perf cgroup profiling.\n* Improved btrfs filesystem support.\n\nRead [This changelog](https://kernelnewbies.org/Linux_5.7) for more detailed information.\n\n## Metasploit 6.0\n\nThe development of Metasploit 6 has finally started, and it ships a lot of awesome features that were missing from the previous versions.\n\n![](../..//assets/blog/4.10/metasploit.jpg)\n\nIt is important to know that this version will break retro-compatibility with previous versions, so it is important for our users to understand what has changed in this version.\n\nOne of the most wanted features is finally here: **end-to-end encryption** in **meterpreter backdoors**, which of course breaks retro-compatibility with older meterpreter payloads.\n\nOther awesome news include the implementation of SMBv3 client support, imprved evasive capabilities via polimorphic payload generation routines.\n\nif you want to read more about Metasploit 6, please read [This article](https://blog.rapid7.com/2020/08/06/metasploit-6-now-under-active-development/).\n\n## Parrot XFCE Edition\n\n![](../..//assets/blog/4.10/xfce.jpg)\n\nWe now officially support the XFCE Desktop Environment. We will improve it in later months using the feedback from our users, and we want to provide it as a valid alternative to MATE and KDE.\n\nyou can download the XFCE image from here [https://download.parrot.sh/parrot/iso/4.10](https://download.parrot.sh/parrot/iso/4.10)\n\n## Greenbone Vulnerability Manager 11.\n\nParrot 4.10 now includes the Greenbone Vulnerability Management (GVM) 11 framework which was formerly known as OpenVAS.\nThe GVM package now follows the new Debian packaging style.\n\n[Read the Greenbone 11 changelog](https://community.greenbone.net/t/gvm-11-release/3676)\n\n## KDE Konsole bug\n\nThere was a bug in KDE that prevented console tools to be launched from the menu. This bug was finally fxed upstream in the KDE repos, but debian has not yet delivered the updated version, so Parrot 4.10 is still affected by that.\n\n![](../..//assets/blog/4.10/kde-bug.jpg)\n\nA special page will alert people trying to download the KDE edition and explain the issue, and updated images will be released as soon as the fix is included in Debian.\n\nThe system is still usable and the affected tools can still be launched from the console, and it will be automatically fixed with later system updates.\n\n## Noticeable updates for developers\n\nVSCodium, the open-source binary distribution of VSCode with telemetry removed at source level, is still our default development tool, and it was updated to its latest version (1.47.3). Geany (with some Parrot customizations) is also pre-installed for those running on less powerful hardware.\n\nParrot now ships with Python 3.8, go 1.14 and gcc 10.1 and 9.3 by default, and we have improved our development metapackages by adding nim support.\n\nOpen a terminal window, type sudo apt show parrot-devel- and press TAB a couple of times to get the list of available packages from the bash autocompletion.\n\nComplete the command with the package of your choice to know more about the features delivered (i.e. apt show parrot-devel-golang).\n\nAdditional metapackages for developers will come soon.\n\n\n\n## Other updates from upstream providers\n\nAs always this version ships with all the latest updates from our upstream sources (mostly Debian), so every new fix, improvement (or bug) is now included in Parrot 4.10 as well.\n\nFrom the firefox browser to the mate desktop environment, all the awesome upates and security fixes from upstream sources since the previous release are now part of the Parrot repository and hence part of this new release.\n\n\n# Follow the stream\n\n\nYou can follow our development progress [here](https://nest.parrotsec.org/org/parrot/-/blob/master/README.md).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy hacking\n","slug":"2020-08-16-parrot-4.10-release-notes"},{"date":"May 8, 2020","title":"Parrot OS + HackTheBox","author":"palinuro","image":"/assets/blog/htb-parrot.jpg","description":"The partnership between Parrot OS and HackTheBox is now official.

on the ohter hand, we are sorry to announce you that we were forced to remove many pentest tools that were abandoned for years and never upgraded to python 3, so we were forced to deprecate them as well.\n\nWe are not alone in this choice, and other pentest distributions like Kali were forced to take the same move.\n\nWe are now searching for new tools (quality ones) to replace some of the missing ones, and we would love to write some of them in the near future.\n\n## Other updates from upstream providers\n\nAs always this version ships with all the latest updates from our upstream sources (mostly Debian), so every new fix, improvement (or bug) is now included in Parrot 4.9 as well.\n\nFrom the firefox browser to the mate desktop environment, from the introduction of GCC 10 ang golang 1.14 to the important upgrades of vscodium and virtualbox, all the awesome upates from upstream sources are now part of the Parrot repository as well.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHappy hacking\n","slug":"2020-04-30-parrot-4.9-release-notes"},{"date":"Mar 20, 2020","title":"Parrot 4.8 Release Notes","author":"palinuro","image":"/assets/blog/macaw-poly2.jpg","description":"Parrot 4.8 is now available for download, read the release notes","content":"\n# Parrot 4.8 is here\n\nParrot is based on Debian Testing, meaning that Parrot 4.8 includes all the updates that landed in the Debian testing repository between september 2019 and march 2020\n\nSome noticeable updates include:\n\n* linux 5.4\n* mate 1.24\n* revision of the sandbox\n* updated anonsurf\n* aircrack 1.6\n* airgeddon 10.01\n* beef 0.5.0\n* burpsuote 2020.1\n* vscodium 1.43\n* libreoffice 6.4 (base was removed)\n* metasploit 5.0.74 (updates will be released soon)\n* nodejs 10.17\n* postgresql 11\n* radare2 4.2\n* radare-cutter 1.10 (ghidra support coming soon)\n* weevely 4.0\n* wine 5.0\n\nand many many other updates.\n\n# Docker updates\n\nWe wanted to stress the importance of containers and Parrot as a Service, since we want anyone to be able to use the Parrot tools on their favorite desktop OS or in the cloud.\n\nnow we offer the following docker containrs that can be run on any docker-supported operating system:\n\n* parrotsec/core\n* parrosec/security\n* parrotsec/tools-nmap\n* parrotsec/tools-metasploit\n* parrotsec/tools-metasploit\n* parrotsec/tools-beef\n* parrotsec/tools-bettercap\n* parrotsec/tools-sqlmap\n\n\nA detailed description of the whole Parrot for docker project, the available containers, their usage and a quick reference is available [here](https://nest.parrot.sh/build/docker-images/-/blob/master/README.md)\n\n\n# New Team Workflow\n\nParrot 4.8 is an important release after months since the last major update.\n\nThe Parrot team wanted to spend a lot of time re-organizing its internal structure, from the operations and workflow of developers, up to the infrastructure.\n\nAfter such a huge work, we have finally moved to the new workflow, and Parrot 4.8 is the proof of how hard we wanted such changes to take place in the project and how smooth development and cooperation became after achieving this goal.\n\n\n","slug":"2020-03-20-parrot-4.8-release-notes"},{"date":"Nov 6, 2019","title":"The Parrot Project needs your help","author":"marafed","image":"/assets/blog/macaw-vaporwave.jpg","description":null,"content":"\n## The Parrot Project needs your help! \n\nWe need your help to going through our work.

Although we have a vast network of mirrors, the central network needs significant resources to be able to correctly redirect to the correct mirror, avoid any censorship in countries with limitations and guarantee security updates in a very short time. Over the years we have even developed our own CDN service (have a look here: https://docs.parrotlinux.org/weathermap/), to have more control over the infrastructure and not allow third parties to read and tamper with traffic.\n\nThe archive only requires multiple nodes of at least 1 TB of storage each, the overall infrastructure receives more than 500 requests per second, the Redis service requires at least 24GB of RAM per node for the correct redirection of resources, and, despite everything, we can keep the costs of this infrastructure lower than impossible.\n\nWe are lucky to be a huge community, but from this community the number of donors is very low, at the moment it amounts to 33 in total, for a system that is used by hundreds of thousands of people in the world.\n\nCurrently, with the donations we receive, developers (who contribute purely on a voluntary basis, without any kind of remuneration) are forced to self tax themselves to keep the machines that are the foundations of our structure standing.\n\n## How to contribute\n\nIf you want to give your contribution to the project, head on our donations page and feel free to become a stable sponsor via Patreon, or send your one-shot contribution via PayPal.\n\nWe also love Cryptocurrencies, and Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum, Stellar Lumens and other cryptocurrencies are more than welcome.\n\n[Donations Page](https://docs.parrotlinux.org/donate)\n\n\nKeep Pwning!\n","slug":"2019-11-06-the-parrot-project-needs-your-help"},{"date":"Sep 18, 2019","title":"Parrot 4.7 release notes","author":"palinuro","image":"/assets/blog/macaw-poly2.jpg","description":null,"content":"\n# Parrot 4.7 development notes\n\nWe are proud to announce the release of Parrot 4.7, which represents an important step forward for our project.\n\n# How to update\n\nDownload the latest release from our [official download page](https://www.parrotlinux.org/download.php)\n\nUpdate your existing Parrot system with the following command\n\n```bash\nsudo parrot-upgrade\n```\n\nOr use the raw apt command\n\n```bash\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt full-upgrade\n```\n\nDon't forget to use this command regularly (at least once a week) to receive the latest security updates and bugfixes from the Parrot repository.\n\n---\n\n# Domain changes\n\nTo reflect the neutrality of a distro that started as a pentest-only system and became more general purpose later with Parro Home, the community voted through a democratic process to switch to parrotlinux.org as the new default domain of the project.\n\nWe will still use parrotsec.org for other things (included the old email addresses), and we introduced other project domains to handle specific parts of the infrastructure.\n\n# Repository changes\n\nWe are preparing to integrate a future LTS branch, so we decided to rename the current repository from stable to rolling.\nNothing changes for the end user, and the current Parrot branch will continue to behave the same as before, but now with a different name to better reflect the rolling release nature of the system, waiting for the LTS edition to join the Parrot OS family along side the rolling branch in a similar way OpenSUSE does.\n\n# New menu structure and tools improvements\n\nThe pentesting menu structure was refactored and re-designed to make tools easier to access in a more logical hierarchical structure.\nNew tools were also added to the project, and we plan to add even more in the future. Not all of them are going to be pre-installed, but a good set of tools in our repository enables pentesters to build up the perfect pentest system for their specific needs, regardless the default package selection picked by our team.\n\n# New sandbox behavior (opt-in rather than opt-out)\n\nSandboxing is a great thing, and we were in the first line when we introduced our custom firejail+apparmor solution for the first time many years ago.\nWe still want to improve such feature and we have a whole team dedicated to improve sandboxing and hardening of the Parrot system, but we had to face the many users with issues caused by the restrictions of our sandbox.\n\nIn Parrot 4.7 the sandbox is disabled by default, and users can decide wether to start an application sandboxed or not. You can easily start the sandboxed version of an installed program from the /sandbox/ folder or from a dedicated menu that we plan to improve in the future (meanwhile the search feature of the bottom menu will fit all your needs), or you can re-enable it by default by using the `firecfg` tool.\n\n# Latest Linux 5.2\n\nThe new ISO files of Parrot 4.7 are being released only now, but we were the first Debian derivative distribution to introduce Linux 5.1 and 5.2 to all our users, and now we are ready to offer it also with our ISO files rebild cycle to support more devices and integrate all the latest linux features from the beginning.\n\n# New MATE 1.22 release\n\nParrot 4.7 ships with the latest MATE 1.22 desktop environment.\n\n# Miscellaneous\n\nNew firefox 69, the latest radare2 and cutter versions and many other important upgrades are all aboard as expected in a properly developed rolling release distro.\n","slug":"2019-09-18-parrot-4-7-release-notes"},{"date":"Aug 6, 2019","title":"Repository Changes","author":"marafed","image":"/assets/blog/macaw-vaporwave.jpg","description":null,"content":"\nHey some of you may have noticed your source list URIs went from deb.parrotsec.org to deb.parrot.sh :slight_smile: this is part of the [migration from parrotsec.org to parrot.sh](https://community.parrot.sh/t/infrastructure-outage/9212).

We love Mate but we'd heard great things\n\nabout KDE and decided we could try and support two desktop environments. Because of the\n\nwork required to change everything from Mate to KDE. We started with KDE Home. The\n\nfeedback was immediate, you guys loved it. The recurring request since has been \"how do I\n\nadd the tools\". We heard you and it is finally here! A Security edition featuring the KDE\n\nPlasma desktop environment.\n\nWe now offer both MATE and KDE images for the Home and Security editions.\n\n![parrot security kde](../img/parrot-4.6-kde-security.jpg)\n\n---\n\n# System Changes\n\n## Appearance\n\nOur design [team](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/team/#design-team) developed a new, ultra, awesome visual experience for Parrot 4.6,\n\nfeast your eyes on a new boot-splash animation and desktop background!\n\nThe desktop-base and parrot-wallpapers also received some love and are updated to reflect\n\nsuch changes including the new Parrot appearence.\n\n**Note:** The themes and icons are still the same.\n\n---\n\n## APT now enforces https\n\nWe have modified our APT implementation to support https-to-http downgrades.\n\nThis allowed us to configure our repository as https by default. For visual reference\n\n\nParrot 4.6 is now configured to serve signed index files via https by default,\nand the mirror redirector is configured to redirect traffic to https mirrors when available.\nIn case an https mirror is not available, the packages are downloaded by fallback http mirrors, but APT will still verify the signatures.\n\nIn other debian-based systems and previous Parrot OS versions, mirrors used http by default, and https is just an exception.\n\nHttp downloads don't represent a security risk because gpg signatures are more effective\n\nthan ssl downloads in certifying repository integrity, as described on [this website - https://whydoesaptnotusehttps.com/](https://whydoesaptnotusehttps.com/).\n\nAlthough you can never eliminate risk of bad actors, we hope to increase the cost for\n\nproviders attempting to intercept or track user activities (i.e. knowing if a\n\nuser is installing specific software).\n\n---\n\n## Improved drivers support\n\nParrot 4.6 includes the Linux 4.19 kernel which contains several security patches,\n\nperformance improvements and a better hardware support.\n\nMoreover Parrot 4.6 features important updates for broadcom and other wireless chipset manufacturers,\n\nand the Nvidia drivers were updated to the latest 410 version with better Quadro support.\n[Debian Kernel Changelog](https://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs//main/l/linux-signed-arm64/linux-signed-arm64_4.19.28+2_changelog) - [Linux changelog](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.19)\n\n---\n\n## Anonsurf has OpenNIC support\nAnonsurf now integrates a new option to change from the system DNS servers to OpenNIC DNS resolvers.\n\n[OpenNIC](https://www.opennic.org) is a community-driven dns resolver provider that respects\n\nuser freedom and allows domain resolution of some special top level domains.\n\n![OpenNIC features](../img/parrot-4.6-opennic.png)\n\n---\n\n# Minor updates\n\n## Better snap support\nNow when you install from snap it will show up in the applications menu by default.\n\n## AppArmor and Firejail profiles have been updated\nWe are constantly trying to rebuild the sandbox :) We love firejail and AppArmor and we\n\nhope to achieve a state of near hassle-free setup and use. Sandboxed applications in\n\nParrot OS are now more stable and reliable than before, and we are pushing forward with\n\nplans to not only add more profiles but utilize firejail's capabilites to their fullest.\n\n## Better OpenVPN support\n\nSetting up your VPN should be painless and quick. Network-manager now integrates all the\n\navailable VPN plugins by default, allowing that experience to be just that.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nThe MATE desktop environment received some minor stability updates, and Firefox 65 is now included.\n\n# New additions\n\n## Matrix and Riot.IM\nWe love federated instant messaging protocols! We love [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/about/) and [Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/index) for what they bring to the table.\n\nThough we like [Dino](https://dino.im/) we realized we wanted something that was sexy, lightweight\nand worked with XMPP and MTProto. Using Matrix does all of this and more through bridges.\n\n[Revolt](https://github.com/aperezdc/revolt) is a [Riot.IM](https://about.riot.im/) desktop integration written mostly in Python, and shell fits our needs perfectly.\n\n(Riot.IM is a chat client built on the Matrix protocol.)\n\nThere are several Matrix clients to pick from and we're still testing. But as we work to\n\nmove our community torward XMPP and Matrix we think it makes sense to have Revolt, you\n\nnever know when skynet will be activated :)\n\n## Reverse Engineering\nWhile we evaluate the inclusion of NSA's Ghidra, we decided to include [Cutter](https://github.com/radareorg/cutter), the powerful GUI to radare2, which is one of the most powerful reverse engineering frameworks out there.\n\nCutter makes it easier to work with the radare2 framework and pushes Parrot's reverse engineering capabilities to a new level.\n\n## Tool updates\n\nMany tools received important updates since the release of Parrot 4.5. From airgeddon to metasploit up to the latest bettercap version. All the tools are now up to date with their latest versions.\n\n## Developer Support\n\nSince the introduction of the `parrot-devel` metapackage family, we worked hard to improve the overall development experience in Parrot.\n\nIn that regard we have awesome news! The devel metapackage now includes the latest gcc\n\nand clang versions, an important security update for java (openjdk), and a big jump from\n\nnodejs 8.11 to the latest 10.15 version. And finally the inclusion of dbeaver as the default database manager.\n\nMetapackages were improved to be more modular and lightweight by default. The mono\n\nruntime and development tools were moved to `parrot-devel-extra` and are no longer pre-installed.\n\n---\n\n## The Road ahead\n\nThe Parrot Project has gone through some considerably large evolutions. We've added over 20 new members, redesigned our internal structures and processes, upgraded our server infrastructure and deployed our own CDN. As we look at where we want to go we realize that we need to automate things more as well as harden ParrotOS from boot to browsing.\n\n","slug":"2019-04-26-parrot-4-6-release-notes"},{"date":"Jan 21, 2019","title":"Parrot 4.5 release notes","author":"palinuro","image":"/assets/blog/macaw-poly2.jpg","description":null,"content":"\n\n## Parrot 4.5 development notes\n\nParrot 4.5 is officially released, and there are some major changes under the hood.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n<a href=\"https://www.parrotsec.org/download-home.php\">\n![Parrot 4.5 download](../img/parrot-4.5-download.jpg)\n</a>\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n## Dropped 32bit architecture images\n\nWe are in 2019 now,  and computers that are not capable of running 64bit and complex applications operating system are mostly old, legacy computers. To add to that, many programs and frameworks are no longer available for 32bit x86 systems.\n\n![Old crap](../img/parrot-4.5-old-crap-pc.jpg)\n\nWe have released 32bit (i386 Architecture) images since the beginning of the project, and we worked hard to provide fresh binary updates for the i386 architecture for a long time; However, 32bit-only computers are no longer capable of running a full pentest campaign or providing hardware-accelerated support to our security protection systems.\n\nParrot 4.5 no longer provides any live ISO files for the i386 architecture, even if it is still supported by our repository and our netinstall images. We are slowly planning to drop support for it in the future.\n\nNOTE: 32bit deprecation does not affect our ARM support, and armhf architecture is still fully supported.\n\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n## Virtual Appliances\n\nWe released official docker templates for parrot many months ago, and they proved to be a turnkey solution to bring a full parrot pentest stack on top of any operating system supported by docker.\n\n![virtual appliance](../img/parrot-4.5-virtualbox-ova.png)\n\nThe next step that comes with Parrot 4.5 is the release of desktop virtual appliances in the OVA format that can be imported in VirtualBox, VMWare and other famous virtualization environments.\n\nThese virtual environments are still experimental, and even if they are the perfect solution to give Parrot a try and experiment with it, we still recommend a full custom installation from the ISO files for best chances of being supported and easier configuration and troubleshooting.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Linux 4.19\n\nLinux 4.19 is the default kernel in Parrot 4.5, and this new kernel version was already packaged by following our new kernel distribution policy implemented for Parrot 5.0 LTS.\n\n![linux 4.19](../img/parrot-4.5-linux-4.19.jpg)\n\nWe plan to support 2 kernel branches, a stable kernel and a testing kernel, and provide updates for both. Linux 4.19 is part of our testing branch, while the first release of the stable branch will be released with Parrot 5.0 itself.\n\nRead the full PSC [here - https://nest.parrotsec.org/parrot-organization/parrot-standards-codex/issues/2](https://nest.parrotsec.org/parrot-organization/parrot-standards-codex/issues/2). \n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Metasploit 5.0  \n\n![metasploit 5](../img/parrot-4.5-metasploit-5.jpg)\n\\\nMetasploit 5.0 was released with many new important features that we immediately imported and tested for our users.\n\nWe absolutely loved the new evasion modules, the opportunity to write shellcode in C, the new search engine, the integrated web services or the json-rpc daemon, and we wanted to offer quick access to this awesome framework through this new Parrot release.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Better Dev Tools\n\nWe improved our metapackages for developers, and setting up an advanced development environment for several programming languages and frameworks is now easier than ever:\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### parrot-devel\n\nIt is pre-installed in Parrot 4.5 and provides the following tools:\n\n* vscodium - an advanced and extensible text editor.\n* zeal - an offline documentation downloader and browser.\n* git-cola - a graphic client to GIT.\n* meld - a graphic patch inspector.\n* tora - a graphic database frontend compatible with several database backends.\n\nThese packages are included in the metapackage by using the \"Recommends\" apt directive, and they can be removed individually without triggering the removal of the whole parrot-devel metapackage.\n\nThe metapackage also recommends the installation of parrot-devel-tools.\n\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install parrot-devel\n```\n\n&nbsp;\n\n\n### parrot-devel-tools\n\nIt is recommended by parrot-devel and pre-installed in Parrot Security.\nIt provides some useful compilers and interpreters for the most used languages and provides the following packages:\n\n* GCC/G++ - a compiler collection for C, C++ and other languages.\n* python3 - the cpython interpreter for the python 3.6 and 3.7 language.\n* ruby - the official ruby lang interpreter and basic toolkit (includes irb and ri as well).\n\nThe package also recommends the following packages, that can be safely removed without triggering the removal of the entire parrot-devel-tools metapackage:\n\n* default-jdk - the latest Java OpenJDK distribution for Java 11 (both JDK and JRE).\n* cython3 - a compiler for the cython language, a strongly-typed dialect of python for efficient code.\n* rust/cargo - the rust compiler and devel tools and its package management system.\n* valac - the vala c compiler.\n* mono-devel - the development tools for the MONO framework, an open source implementation of .net.\n* mono-runtime - the runtime of the MONO framework compatible and interoperable with the latest .net runtime.\n* php-cli - the PHP 7.3 language plus its command line interface and some useful core libraries.\n* perl6 - the PERL 6 interpreter and core libraries.\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install parrot-devel-tools\n```\n&nbsp;\n\n\n### parrot-devel-extra\n\nThe parrot-devel-extra metapackage is a quick way to install many additional development utilities like advanced IDEs, additional languages, debuggers and extra tools.\n\n* golang - go language compiler and runtime\n* nodejs - node.js framework\n* npm - node.js package manager\n* atom - advanced and extensible editor by github\n* qtcreator - powerful C, C++ and Qt/QML IDE and debugger.\n* kdevelop - advanced general purpose IDE by KDE.\n* edb-debugger - graphical debugger.\n* jad - Java decompiler.\n* nasm - powerful general purpose x86 assembler.\n* radare2 - advanced command line hexadecimal editor.\n* cmake - cross-platform, open-source make system.\n* valgrind - nstrumentation framework for building dynamic analysis tools.\n* devscripts/build-essential - useful development utilities for debian developers/maintainers.\n\n```\nsudo apt update\nsudo apt install parrot-devel-extra\n```\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Other updates\n\nMany more updates were imported since we are currently based on Debian testing, and we included all the latest updates, security patches and new features as usual.\n\n\n\n\n","slug":"2019-01-21-parrot-4-5-release-notes"},{"date":"Jan 3, 2019","title":"The Parrot CDN","author":"palinuro","image":"/assets/blog/macaw-poly2.jpg","description":null,"content":"\n\n# the Parrot CDN\nHello mates, we are proud to announce the release of our dedicated CDN (Content Delivery Network)\n\nIt consists of several servers all around the world that host a fully operational caching and delivery system of all the content of our website\n\nThis servers network is completely driven by us (no external services involved) and all the data goes directly to servers we own.\n\nThanks to very powerful technologies like GeoDNS and IP Anycast, if someone hits a parrot website, it is served automatically by the nearest servers according to the ip location of the client.\n\nBy having our own CDN we can move away from cloudflare and other third party services, provide fast content delivery, provide failover routes in case of network congestions, downtimes or attacks and offer a better and more private services to all our users.\n\n\n# how to test the CDN\n\ntest how the CDN sees your requests:\n\n    ┌─[palinuro@parrot]─[~]\n    └──╼ $ dig -t txt @ns.parrotsec.io director.geo.parrotsec.org | grep country\n\n    director.geo.parrotsec.org. 30\tIN\tTXT\t\"ip 185.178.92.254 v4 city gavardo country it ita state eu region 09 name unknown as as206701\"\n\n\ntest how the CDN resolves for you:\n\n    ┌─[✗]─[palinuro@parrot]─[~]\n    └──╼ $ host director.geo.parrotsec.org\n\n    director.geo.parrotsec.org has address 89.36.210.176\n    director.geo.parrotsec.org has address 80.211.238.94\n    director.geo.parrotsec.org has IPv6 address 2a03:a140:10:10e6::1\n    director.geo.parrotsec.org has IPv6 address 2a03:b0c0:3:e0::105:5001\n\n\ntest how the CDN caches content:\n\n    ┌─[palinuro@parrot]─[~]\n    └──╼ $ curl -I https://www.parrotsec.org/img/logo.png 2> /dev/null | grep X-Cache-Status\n\n    X-Cache-Status: HIT\n\n* `MISS` – The response was not found in the cache and so was fetched from an origin server.

This has worked surprisingly well until now, but &#8211; luckily I would say &#8211; we&#8217;ve finally reached the point where such limited support could hinder its future growth if we don&#8217;t take action now to expand our funding sources.\n  </p>\n  \n  <p class=\"line\" data-line=\"11\">\n    I know what you might be thinking now, but here&#8217;s where the good news comes in: even now, at this topical time of expansion and increasing development in our history, nothing is changing, nor will ever change, in terms of our how everything runs behind the scenes of our favourite distro, no matter how large the project will grow, or how widely adopted it will become.\n  </p>\n  \n  <p class=\"line\" data-line=\"13\">\n    The entire team will keep writing its code with the same passion and commitment as they always have, even with the limited resources we have right now, Lorenzo will still and always be in complete and exclusive control of the private keys required to approve system updates, each and every one of our builds will still have the same level of high quality automation behind it and &#8211; at the same time &#8211; of attention in their thorough and extensive manual review. And beyond this, we&#8217;ll keep experimenting and testing out new and diverse paths to make the distro even more more feature-rich, secure, fun, and effective to use, hopefully even &#8211; one day &#8211; in directions that now are simply out of reach for the current scale of the project.\n  </p>\n  \n  <p class=\"line\" data-line=\"15\">\n    At the same time, however, we need to start investing our time and efforts into the search for new ways of doing what we already do, in order to power the next X years of Parrot, all while keeping 100% true to our ideals, and fiercely maintaining our no-compromise approach towards transparency and trustworthiness, which are the building blocks of our identity, and rock solid security, towards which we devote sleepless nights of our lives, taking it to extreme and paranoid levels of care in execution.\n  </p>\n  \n  <p class=\"line\" data-line=\"17\">\n    Among the most important objectives we&#8217;ve set ourselves are:\n  </p>\n  \n  <ol>\n    <li>\n      The construction of a robust and reliable build infrastructure, where our already highly advanced pipelines can run in heavily secured environments.\n    </li>\n    <li>\n      The expanse of our OS in public and private sectors, especially in Italy, where we are located.

We clone the vscode repository, we lay down a customized product.json that has Microsoft specific functionality (telemetry, gallery, logo, etc.), and then produce a build that we release under our license.\n> \n> When you clone and build from the vscode repo, none of these endpoints are configured in the default product.json. Therefore, you generate a &#8220;clean&#8221; build, without the Microsoft customizations, which is by default licensed under the MIT license\n\nVSCodium is a community project to distribute a binary release of VSCode without any Microsoft branding, telemetry and tracking feature.\n\n<img class=\"alignright wp-image-240 \" src=\"https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-at-2018-11-25-21-49-20.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"349\" height=\"123\" srcset=\"https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-at-2018-11-25-21-49-20.png 742w, https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-at-2018-11-25-21-49-20-300x106.png 300w, https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-at-2018-11-25-21-49-20-230x81.png 230w, https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-at-2018-11-25-21-49-20-350x124.png 350w, https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-at-2018-11-25-21-49-20-480x169.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 349px) 100vw, 349px\" />\n\nParrot 4.4 uses VSCodium as its new advanced editor instead of Atom, because the atom binary packages became too bloated and too heavy (up to 850MB of storage space), **without** considering the bare minimum set of plugins that are necessary to make Atom a complete environment. VSCodium in the other hand is very lightweight (less than 200MB) and it is way faster than both Atom and Visual Studio Code, with a smaller memory footprint, and it provides many important features by default and without any need of external plugins (advanced intellisense, code inspector, debugger, git interface, broader languages support etc).\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## New Golang, Rust, Vala and Mono support\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-242\" src=\"https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/how-to-choose-a-programming-language.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"360\" srcset=\"https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/how-to-choose-a-programming-language.png 700w, https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/how-to-choose-a-programming-language-300x154.png 300w, https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/how-to-choose-a-programming-language-230x118.png 230w, https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/how-to-choose-a-programming-language-350x180.png 350w, https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/how-to-choose-a-programming-language-480x247.png 480w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 700px) 100vw, 700px\" />\n\nThere is a big interest in the Parrot team to offer a comfortable environment for software developers and those pentesters who usually write or modify their tools, and even if we already support python, java, c/c++, ruby, perl, bash and php, there is a big interest in the community in other emerging programming languages like golang, rust or vala.\n\nParrot 4.4 added for the first time full support for golang, rust, vala and mono (a FLOSS and independent .NET implementation). We believe software developers will benefit from this internal choice that required a lot of effort in order to keep the ISO files within their usual sizes.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## New Privacy Metapackage\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-243\" src=\"https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/privacy-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"979\" />\n\nparrot-privacy now provides all the privacy-related applications as anonsurf, torbrowser, ricochet-im, onionshare and more.\n\nPeople who need stronger privacy have now a dedicated metapackage.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## KDE Plasma Edition\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-244\" src=\"https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/photo_2018-11-23_17-58-28.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400px\" />\n\nThe development of the KDE Plasma edition gave very interesting results, and now Parrot 4.4 provides an awesome KDE flavor with our custom themes and settings for all our users that don&#8217;t like MATE and prefer a more advanced and feature-rich (but heavier) desktop environment.\n\nParrot KDE includes the latest 5.13 Plasma desktop with custom configurations that proved to be very lightweight and fast with a small memory footprint, and we will continue to improve this flavor in the future.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## BTRFS and XFS are the new default filesystem\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-245\" src=\"https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-at-2018-11-25-22-08-18.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" />\n\nThe new Debian-Installer was modified to use **btrfs by default** for root and xfs for the home filesystem. The installer does no longer create a swap partition when automatically partitioning uefi or encrypted systems, and the boot partition is large enough to host multiple kernel revisions without running out of space.\n\nBtrfs and xfs are very powerful advanced filesystems with CoW, subvolumes, snapshots and other features. While xfs is very fast on some specific workloads, btrfs has additional features like live compression and a very efficient checksuming system for file corruption detection.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-246\" src=\"https://blog.parrotsec.org/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot_generic_2018-11-25_220831.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\"/>\n\nBtrfs was considered experimental for many years and it is still under heavy development, but its core features are now stable and production ready (but not ready for mission critical scenarios) and many companies already use it and contribute to its development, including facebook, suse, oracle and more. We think it is ready for desktop use and we actively used it on all our personal computers, testing machines, workstations and servers (yes, parrot servers use btrfs almost everywhere), and it proved to be very stable and reliable.","slug":"2018-11-25-parrot-4-4-release-notes"},{"date":"Nov 4, 2018","title":"Parrot 4.3 Release Notes","author":"palinuro","image":"/assets/blog/macaw-poly2.jpg","description":null,"content":"**Parrot 4.3 is now available for download.**\n\nThis release provides security and stability updates and is the starting point for our plan to develop an LTS edition of Parrot.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n### Our plans for Parrot LTS\n\nWe are working on a Parrot LTS branch, a long term support, release-based distribution to provide long term reliability to our users for all our architectures.\n  \nOur plans are to release it along side the next Debian stable release, which is planned for the next year.\n  \nWe will continue to provide a rolling release branch for the x86_64 architecture where to include all the major version updates for our tools and test all our new features.\n\nIn our vision LTS does not mean outdated. We believe that our LTS branch should follow the native release process of all the tools and system components that we include, and we will not keep outdated and unsupported package versions in the repo, but we are working on new build nodes to provide updated backports for all the supported software.\n\nOf course Parrot 4.3 is not LTS yet, but it was developed as a middle step to our final goal that we plan to reach within the next summer.\n\n### \n\n### Linux 4.18\n\nLinux was updated to the 4.18.10 version, and linux 4.19 will be released soon.\n\n### Firefox 63\n\nFirefox 63 provides noticeable security and privacy features, but it is no longer available to 32bit systems, so we switched to firefox-esr on all the unsupported architectures.\n\n### Wine menu\n\nWe fixed a bug in the parrot menu configuration that prevented several menu categories to show up.\n  \nThis fixed the missing wine menu bug, which is now back again.\n\n### Bashrc updates\n\nThe Parrot .bashrc file was updated, now it provides better snap support, the _ll_ alias now shows the size in a human readable format and it does no longer overwrite some global settings as it used to do before.\n\n### Java 11\n\nOpenJDK 11 is now the default java provider.\n\n### Anonsurf\n\nAnonsurf received important stability upgrades and now it does not mess up the dns configuration.\n\n### New Parrot icons\n\nThe Parrot edition of the MAIA icon theme was updated.\n  \nWe dropped many old unused icons and replaced them with newer ones.\n\n### Core updates\n\nParrot 4.3 provides the latest updates of Debian Testing and many improvements to our sandbox system, in fact both firejail and apparmor received significant updates, and now the whole system is smoother, more secure and more reliable.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Download\n\n[Download Parrot 4.3](https://www.parrotsec.org/download.php)\n\n&nbsp;\n\n## Upgrade from a previous version\n\n> sudo full-upgrade\n\nor\n\n> sudo apt update\n

You will always have access to all the parrot tools in all the isolated environments you need.\n\nWe also offer different Docker images: a core container with only the bare system, a more complete environment with a lot of useful tools, and a container dedicated to the metasploit environment.

The first experiments were already introduced in Parrot 3.9 with the inclusion of firejail, but we took almost a month of hard work to make it even better with the improvement of many profiles, the introduction of the apparmor support and enough time to make all the tests.\n\nIn Parrot 3.10 we also introduced the new Firefox 57 (Quantum) that landed on Parrot very naturally with a complete browser restyle. The release of Firefox 57 with our favorite plugins and our custom profile was possible thanks to the help of the Italian Mozilla Community, that welcomed us as members of their beautiful family.\n  \nWe are a privacy-respecting GNU/Linux distribution and we will join the Mozilla Community and similar organizations in our common mission of protecting the internet and its users with privacy awareness campaigns and with resilient, free and effective self-defense tools.\n\nThe other big news is the introduction of the latest Linux 4.14 kernel, and it is a very important improvement for us because of the awesome features of this new kernel release and its improved hardware support.\n\nAll the updates that Debian introduced since the last Parrot release were tested and slowly introduced in our stable branch, and, since then, we have seen many improvements, bug-fixes and security updates that we are proud to ship with our new ISO files. We release very frequent updates to our ISO files because it is important for us to provide the latest security patches and the latest Debian packages to those users who have to use Parrot in Live Mode.\n\nSome of our pentest tools received some important upstream updates, like metasploit-framework, that reached its 4.21 version, or maltegoce and casefile that were merged into a unique launcher provided by the new maltego 4.1.\n  \nThe project encountered some difficulties with the maintenance of some tools that stopped us from working on an effective arsenal restyle and forced us to stay on our current development line, and we will soon require the help of our community to do a full restyle of our tools archive with the introduction of many useful programs that many community members wanted us to introduce.\n\nAt last, but not least, we included some lightweight but useful programs for daily tasks for our users who have parrot as their main system. We included a todo list and planner program, a personal finance management suite and a mind map designer.\n\nWe have tried to make custom flavors for other desktop environments but they were not working as expected and we decided to postpone their release for the future to take the time to make them better.

Our OpenNIC nodes were not yet added to the OpenNIC server list but we would love to add them in the future.\n\nParrot 3.7 and 3.8 were also subject to the introduction of apparmor, and selinux will be introduced by default very soon.\n\nParrot Lite has received some improvements, for example now it includes libreoffice, and some useless packages were dropped to make the system faster and more lightweight.

The most important result is that now the central repository is replicated over 2 servers, and both of them host the geo redirector that redirects every request to one of our mirror servers around the world.\n\nWe are still working on our new build infrastructure and more hardware is required to complete everything and have it up and running as expected, if you want to contribute with a donation (both money or hardware) feel free to visit our [Donations Page (https://docs.parrotsec.org/donate)](https://docs.parrotsec.org/donate) or contact palinuro AT parrotsec DOT org (spam it and we will hire a hitman for you).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nLet&#8217;s finish with a little note on what is happening on our ARM side:\n  \nour repository fully supports both armhf (armv7hf &#8211; 32bit with HF) and arm64 (aarch64/armv8 &#8211; 64bit), and all the ARM packages are perfectly synchronized with their equivalent x86 versions. The only problem woth our ARM support is that our current ARM developer was too busy in these months to finish the ARM builds in time, and our current ARM images are based on Parrot 3.4 and are available only for Raspberry Pi\n\nBut on a brighter note a new developer is up to join our ARM team and our current ARM developer will be back on the build platform very soon, and he is already at work to support not only the Raspberry Pi but many other ARM boards like the Pine64 that we would like to adopt as our official embedded board.","slug":"2017-07-10-parrot-3-7-release-notes"},{"date":"Jul 7, 2017","title":"Parrot 3.7 release

it correctly implements that dependency-based init model that systemd is quite far from being able to represent for the eyes of a _Veteran Unix Admin._\n\nBut openrc needs a lot of work to work properly in the debian ecosystem, and the introduction of systemd has slowed down its introduction as a valid alternative in Debian, so we will use the Devuan version of sysvinit and eventually follow the Devuan work, and then switch to openrc when it&#8217;s ready.\n\nBut again, these are just suppositions of how we would like to move in case of a migration.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-120

is not the question, the real question is:\n\nDo we care of what we run at PID 1?\n\nYES, WE FUCKIN&#8217; DO!!\n\n<img class=\"alignnone wp-image-121 size-medium\"

systems when systemd was introduced in most of the GNU/Linux distributions screwing up years and years of synergy.\n\nWe would be happy to see people being able to switch back to systemd on our platform, but we will not waste time and resources to make it easier.\n\n<img class=\"alignnone size-large\" src=\"http://i1.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/000/925/966/8d2.gif\" width=\"480\" height=\"320\" />\n\n**But i want to know what&#8217;s wrong with systemd!**\n\nAgain, we are not here to provide technical reasons about hat is wrong with a wrongly implemented init system, because many other people have deeply studied this situation and can explain it way better than us.\n\nHere some useful resources:\n\n[Linus Torvalds and others on systemd &#8211; ZDnet](http://www.zdnet.com/article/linus-torvalds-and-others-on-linuxs-systemd/) <&#8211; here you can also understand why we don&#8217;t like gnome\n\n[Arguments against systemd &#8211; WithoutSystemd](http://without-systemd.org/wiki/index.php/Arguments_against_systemd)\n\n[<span class=\"c00\">I still don&#8217;t understand why systemd sucks &#8211;

clear, we have nothing to do with those morons who started fundraising campaigns to hire a hitman to kill you, and we hate all the people who are bullying up on you.\n\nWe just consider systemd an immature init system which works almost perfectly on some standard desktop use cases. But we also believe that your approach is destroying that part of the Unix philosophy that made GNU/Linux one of the most stable and reliable systems out there.\n\nWe also dislike the way systemd took us away the sacred graal of choice.\n\nSo, again, nothing personal. Everything that may have hurt your person in this topic happened only because we love memes and freedom, and one of your softwares gave us the former but took us the latter.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n  * Palinuro","slug":"2017-06-13-debian-and-devuan"},{"date":"May 18, 2017","title":"Parrot 3.6 is here","author":"palinuro","image":"/assets/blog/macaw-poly2.jpg","description":null,"content":"After some months of hard work we were finally able to release Parrot 3.6.\n\nIn this new version we didn&#8217;t wanted to introduce new features and functionalities, we have worked instead in making the existing environment better, more reliable and less memory-hungry by applying many minor fixes to our build platform and packages and by tuning our startup daemons management system (Parrot 3.6 Lite 32bit can use less than 200MB of ram).\n\nAnonsurf was improved too, and now the section dedicated to anonymity and privacy is very reliable and well tested, and some nightmares of the precedent anonsurf versions now belong to the past.\n\nWe also wanted to focus more attention to our Lite and Studio editions, because the Parrot Core is not only an awesome security oriented platform, but it is also suitable for more general purpose derivative projects, and workstations and personal computers can only take advantage from a very lightweight debian based system which is ready out of the box with all the customizations and configurations already done by our team.\n\nAlso regarding our derivatives, you should have noticed the download link for Parrot AIR, it is very similar to Parrot Full, but it only integrates our subset of tools dedicated to wireless testing. It was developed for the new [AIRBUD](https://www.alftel.com/pages/product-airbud) board, a very powerful mix between a wireless station and an embedded x86 computer developed by Alftel. Parrot AIR is just a proof of concept, of course, but it will be improved in the future to bring a very nice testing platform for this kind of pentesting boards, and yes, it can be used on a standard computer too like any other x86 edition of Parrot.\n\nAs we mentioned [here](https://blog.parrotsec.org/welcome-to-our-new-parrot-mirror-director/), also the mirror director was improved, for faster downloads and updates, and many new universities, companies and research centers have joined our servers network. But our collaborations are not only related to our mirror servers, we are in touch with some companies and startups that are working hard in the frontier of the cyber security word, and with our team we are working on some side projects regarding IoT and Automotive security, and many laboratories, experiments and public events about these topics are going to involve our community in the near future.\n\nIf your are curious about our work on ARM platforms, feel free to contact us, we have a dedicated team working on it, and even if the development in this field is a bit slower than the x86 one, it is pushing forward and we are going to release updated images for [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/) and [Pine64](https://www.pine64.org/) in the next weeks, while we are already at work to support the new [PineBook](https://www.pine64.org/?page_id=3707) which is an awesome inexpensive laptop built on the arm64 SoC of the Pine64.\n\nWe take education very seriously, and we plan to do many many events with our community dedicated to teaching IT security basics as well as more advanced topics through courses and laboratories provided by our ambassadors, community leaders and developers all around the world!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd PLEASE, [**support us on Patreon**](https://www.patreon.com/parrot), because your contribution is our only hope to survive and make this dream

Parrots, Palinuro here.\n\nI am proud to announce the official release of the new Parrot 3.5 ISO files.\n\nThis update took a lot of time (2 months) as we have not only updated and tested many many packages from debian, but we also tried to play with some new features and dropped some old and obsolete ones.\n\nThis new release will no longer include all those old packages that did not meet the debian standards, and of course we also removed the old and discontinued gtkdialog, that forced us to remove some other softwares built on top of it.\n\nOn a brighter note, native virtualbox and vmware guest support is now included by default.\n  \nThe linux kernel was updated to the latest 4.9.13 release and we are waiting debian to finish the debianization of linux 4.10 to start working on our patches for it.\n\nA virtual machine manager was included by default, but it is neither virtualbox nor the propertary vmware, while we wanted to include virt-manager, which is an awesome manager for KVM and LXC machines that can also control VMs on other computers on your network.\n\nAnother interesting feature is the update of firefox which is not firefox-esr 45, as we wanted to import the new firefox 51 by default.\n\nFor a full list of all the changes we consider being most relevant, take a look at our release changelog.\n\n&nbsp;\n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd don&#8217;t forget to download the

we have improved several things, infact as we announced for the previous version, parrot 3.3 was just a working snapshot (considered as a preview) of the major work we were doing on parrot 3.4, that we were able to finish earlier than expected.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFeel free to read our [changelog](https://github.com/ParrotSec/changelog/tree/master) to have a better overview of what we have done.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOf course a big question that many of you may have is: what happened to Parrot Cloud?\n  \nNo, we don&#8217;t have stopped its development, we have just discovered how pointless it was to provide our Cloud edition through a live ISO.\n  \nInfact we still provide it and you can still get a working parrot cloud environment in 3 ways: with our netboot images (tasksel supports the parrot-cloud metapackages), with our alternate installation script (to install parrot on top of a debian system) and by buying a pre-configured VPS from dasaweb (the official Parrot Cloud VPS provider).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nfeel free to [join our community](https://docs.parrotsec.org/community) and give us your feedback as we are up to take a long pause (we will continue to provide system updates
