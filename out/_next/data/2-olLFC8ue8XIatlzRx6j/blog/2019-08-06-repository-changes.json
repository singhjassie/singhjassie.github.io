{"pageProps":{"post":{"date":"Aug 6, 2019","title":"Repository Changes","slug":"2019-08-06-repository-changes","author":"marafed","content":"\nHey some of you may have noticed your source list URIs went from deb.parrotsec.org to deb.parrot.sh :slight_smile: this is part of the [migration from parrotsec.org to parrot.sh](https://community.parrot.sh/t/infrastructure-outage/9212). This change was put into the apt-parrot package (3.0+parrot2 precisely). Your source list `/etc/apt/sources.list.d/parrot.list` at this time should like this:\n\n```text\n# this file was automatically generated by parrot-mirror-selector\ndeb https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling main contrib non-free\n#deb-src https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling main contrib non-free\ndeb https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling-security main contrib non-free\n#deb-src https://deb.parrot.sh/parrot/ rolling-security main contrib non-free\n```\n\nSpeaking of domain changes and names please checkout @palinuro's [new discussion](https://community.parrot.sh/t/new-parrot-os-domain/9252) on whether a different domain would fit us better.
