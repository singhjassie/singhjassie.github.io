{"pageProps":{"post":{"date":"Jan 4, 2017","title":"Parrot 3.4 released","slug":"2017-01-04-parrot-3-4-released","author":"palinuro","content":"Parrot 3.4.1 was released.\n\nIt was divided into 2 releases, infact we have released parrot 3.4 on january 1, and then the 3.4.1 release to fix a minor bug to the installer as you can see from our changelog.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe haven&#8217;t done big changes since the previous release (parrot 3.3) but we have improved several things, infact as we announced for the previous version, parrot 3.3 was just a working snapshot (considered as a preview) of the major work we were doing on parrot 3.4, that we were able to finish earlier than expected.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nFeel free to read our [changelog](https://github.com/ParrotSec/changelog/tree/master) to have a better overview of what we have done.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nOf course a big question that many of you may have is: what happened to Parrot Cloud?\n  \nNo, we don&#8217;t have stopped its development, we have just discovered how pointless it was to provide our Cloud edition through a live ISO.\n  \nInfact we still provide it and you can still get a working parrot cloud environment in 3 ways: with our netboot images (tasksel supports the parrot-cloud metapackages), with our alternate installation script (to install parrot on top of a debian system) and by buying a pre-configured VPS from dasaweb (the official Parrot Cloud VPS provider).\n\n&nbsp;\n\nfeel free to [join our community](https://docs.parrotsec.org/community) and give us your feedback as we are up to take a long pauseÂ (we will continue to provide system updates through our repositories) to collect new ideas and play with some experimental branches of the IT security universe.","image":"/assets/blog/macaw-poly2.jpg","description":null}},"__N_SSG":true}
