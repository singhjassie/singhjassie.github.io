This has been an especially big three months for us as Parrot 4.6 is also our first release completely served by our network without SaaS services like cloudflare. Everything is on our infrastructure.\n\n# How to update\n\nDownload the latest release from our [official download page](https://www.parrotsec.org/download.php)\n\nUpdate your existing Parrot system with the following command\n\n```bash\nsudo parrot-upgrade\n```\n\nDon't forget to use this command regularly (at least once a week) to receive the latest security updates and bugfixes from the Parrot repository.\n\n---\n\n# Parrot Security KDE Edition\n\nWhen we first added KDE, it was an experiment. We love Mate but we'd heard great things\n\nabout KDE and decided we could try and support two desktop environments. Because of the\n\nwork required to change everything from Mate to KDE. We started with KDE Home. The\n\nfeedback was immediate, you guys loved it. The recurring request since has been \"how do I\n\nadd the tools\". We heard you and it is finally here! A Security edition featuring the KDE\n\nPlasma desktop environment.\n\nWe now offer both MATE and KDE images for the Home and Security editions.\n\n![parrot security kde](../img/parrot-4.6-kde-security.jpg)\n\n---\n\n# System Changes\n\n## Appearance\n\nOur design [team](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/team/#design-team) developed a new, ultra, awesome visual experience for Parrot 4.6,\n\nfeast your eyes on a new boot-splash animation and desktop background!\n\nThe desktop-base and parrot-wallpapers also received some love and are updated to reflect\n\nsuch changes including the new Parrot appearence.\n\n**Note:** The themes and icons are still the same.\n\n---\n\n## APT now enforces https\n\nWe have modified our APT implementation to support https-to-http downgrades.\n\nThis allowed us to configure our repository as https by default. For visual reference\n\n\nParrot 4.6 is now configured to serve signed index files via https by default,\nand the mirror redirector is configured to redirect traffic to https mirrors when available.\nIn case an https mirror is not available, the packages are downloaded by fallback http mirrors, but APT will still verify the signatures.\n\nIn other debian-based systems and previous Parrot OS versions, mirrors used http by default, and https is just an exception.\n\nHttp downloads don't represent a security risk because gpg signatures are more effective\n\nthan ssl downloads in certifying repository integrity, as described on [this website - https://whydoesaptnotusehttps.com/](https://whydoesaptnotusehttps.com/).\n\nAlthough you can never eliminate risk of bad actors, we hope to increase the cost for\n\nproviders attempting to intercept or track user activities (i.e. knowing if a\n\nuser is installing specific software).\n\n---\n\n## Improved drivers support\n\nParrot 4.6 includes the Linux 4.19 kernel which contains several security patches,\n\nperformance improvements and a better hardware support.\n\nMoreover Parrot 4.6 features important updates for broadcom and other wireless chipset manufacturers,\n\nand the Nvidia drivers were updated to the latest 410 version with better Quadro support.\n[Debian Kernel Changelog](https://metadata.ftp-master.debian.org/changelogs//main/l/linux-signed-arm64/linux-signed-arm64_4.19.28+2_changelog) - [Linux changelog](https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v4.x/ChangeLog-4.19)\n\n---\n\n## Anonsurf has OpenNIC support\nAnonsurf now integrates a new option to change from the system DNS servers to OpenNIC DNS resolvers.\n\n[OpenNIC](https://www.opennic.org) is a community-driven dns resolver provider that respects\n\nuser freedom and allows domain resolution of some special top level domains.\n\n![OpenNIC features](../img/parrot-4.6-opennic.png)\n\n---\n\n# Minor updates\n\n## Better snap support\nNow when you install from snap it will show up in the applications menu by default.\n\n## AppArmor and Firejail profiles have been updated\nWe are constantly trying to rebuild the sandbox :) We love firejail and AppArmor and we\n\nhope to achieve a state of near hassle-free setup and use. Sandboxed applications in\n\nParrot OS are now more stable and reliable than before, and we are pushing forward with\n\nplans to not only add more profiles but utilize firejail's capabilites to their fullest.\n\n## Better OpenVPN support\n\nSetting up your VPN should be painless and quick. Network-manager now integrates all the\n\navailable VPN plugins by default, allowing that experience to be just that.\n\n## Miscellaneous\n\nThe MATE desktop environment received some minor stability updates, and Firefox 65 is now included.\n\n# New additions\n\n## Matrix and Riot.IM\nWe love federated instant messaging protocols! We love [XMPP](https://xmpp.org/about/) and [Matrix](https://matrix.org/blog/index) for what they bring to the table.\n\nThough we like [Dino](https://dino.im/) we realized we wanted something that was sexy, lightweight\nand worked with XMPP and MTProto. Using Matrix does all of this and more through bridges.\n\n[Revolt](https://github.com/aperezdc/revolt) is a [Riot.IM](https://about.riot.im/) desktop integration written mostly in Python, and shell fits our needs perfectly.\n\n(Riot.IM is a chat client built on the Matrix protocol.)\n\nThere are several Matrix clients to pick from and we're still testing. But as we work to\n\nmove our community torward XMPP and Matrix we think it makes sense to have Revolt, you\n\nnever know when skynet will be activated :)\n\n## Reverse Engineering\nWhile we evaluate the inclusion of NSA's Ghidra, we decided to include [Cutter](https://github.com/radareorg/cutter), the powerful GUI to radare2, which is one of the most powerful reverse engineering frameworks out there.\n\nCutter makes it easier to work with the radare2 framework and pushes Parrot's reverse engineering capabilities to a new level.\n\n## Tool updates\n\nMany tools received important updates since the release of Parrot 4.5. From airgeddon to metasploit up to the latest bettercap version. All the tools are now up to date with their latest versions.\n\n## Developer Support\n\nSince the introduction of the `parrot-devel` metapackage family, we worked hard to improve the overall development experience in Parrot.\n\nIn that regard we have awesome news! The devel metapackage now includes the latest gcc\n\nand clang versions, an important security update for java (openjdk), and a big jump from\n\nnodejs 8.11 to the latest 10.15 version. And finally the inclusion of dbeaver as the default database manager.\n\nMetapackages were improved to be more modular and lightweight by default. The mono\n\nruntime and development tools were moved to `parrot-devel-extra` and are no longer pre-installed.\n\n---\n\n## The Road ahead\n\nThe Parrot Project has gone through some considerably large evolutions. We've added over 20 new members, redesigned our internal structures and processes, upgraded our server infrastructure and deployed our own CDN. As we look at where we want to go we realize that we need to automate things more as well as harden ParrotOS from boot to browsing.\n\n","image":"/assets/blog/macaw-poly2.jpg","description":null}},"__N_SSG":true}
