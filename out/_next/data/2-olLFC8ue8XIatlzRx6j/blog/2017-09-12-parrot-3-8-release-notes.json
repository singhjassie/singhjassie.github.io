Our OpenNIC nodes were not yet added to the OpenNIC server list but we would love to add them in the future.\n\nParrot 3.7 and 3.8 were also subject to the introduction of apparmor, and selinux will be introduced by default very soon.\n\nParrot Lite has received some improvements, for example now it includes libreoffice, and some useless packages were dropped to make the system faster and more lightweight. No significant changes were performed on Parrot Studio and Parrot AIR except for all the global changes introduced in this new release.\n\n&nbsp;\n\nThe ARM images for various SoC boards will be released in the next days with many interesting features and a broader list of supported boards.\n\n&nbsp;","image":"/assets/blog/macaw-poly2.jpg","description":null}},"__N_SSG":true}
